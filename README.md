# Discord-OpenAI-Bot

## Installation
To install, I downloaded Python 3.11.5, then ran command 'py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py'

### Idea
I created the Discord-OpenAI-Bot from my love for AI and Discord. I wanted to bring together AI Image generation and AI language abilitys to create another person in a discord channel that could talk with you and generate images or give you song ideas. Think of it as a virtual assistant that can change its personality just by changing the context that ChatGPT3 recives.This bot is a beginning that can be built on to make a discord bot that is persoalized to your discord servers needs and wants


### Usage
- Change BOT_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY, and CHANNEL_ID to your own keys or channel ID

- Interact and enjoy the discord bot, context can be changed to change bots personality
